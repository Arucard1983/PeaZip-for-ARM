The basic routines in this archive can be compiled with most current
Pascal (TP 5/5.5/6, BP 7, VP 2.1, FPC 1.0/2.0/2.2/2.4/2.6) and Delphi
versions (tested with V1 up to V7/9/10/12/17).

Since Feb. 2006 there is a new Hash/HMAC architecture: Hash descriptor
records allow a simple and uniform HMAC implementation for all hash
algorithms; the key derivation functions can use all supported hash
algorithms. A separate short introduction (intro.txt) gives some more
information about the Hash/HMAC units and procedures.

Since May 2008 the cryptographic hash and HMAC routines support messages
with arbitrary bit lengths.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The basic routines were slightly improved in the previous versions, but
optimizing seems to be black magic. The cycles/times are heavily dependent
on CPU, cache, compiler, code position, etc. For example: if the SHA256
loop is unrolled, the calculation slows down for about 40% on one machine
(1.8GHz P4, D6, Win98), but is about 15% faster on another (AMD 2600+, D5,
Win98). In the archive sha256unroll.zip you can find some snippets related
to SHA256 loop unrolling.

With the test program T_SpeedA and the high resolution timer from hrtimer
you can measure the CPU cycles per byte (Cyc/B) and the processing rate in
MB/s (note that the CPU frequency is determined dynamically). Here are the
values for Delphi/FPC on Win98 with Pentium 4 / 1.7 GHz using a blocksize
of 50000 bytes (Std: standard routines with BASM, PP: Pure Pascal with
inline for D17 and FPC2.2.4 -O3, D17 on Win7/64 Core i3-2350M):

MD4, eDonkey/eMule: For files/messages with a multiple of 9728000 bytes
the eDonkey and eMule hashes are different; the ed2k unit always
calculates both digests. The demo programs and the FAR plugin display both
values if they are different.

Units SHA5_224 and SHA5_256: In March 2012 NIST released the new Secure
Hash Standard FIPS 180-4. It defines (among others) two additional secure
hash algorithms SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256. These are designed like
SHA384, using the compression function of SHA512 but different IVs. NIST
quote: SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 may be more efficient alternatives to
SHA-224 and SHA-256, respectively, on platforms that are optimized for
64-bit operations. (C.f. the D17-64 column in the table). My Pascal
implementations use the standard SHA512 and are now fully integrated in
CRC/Hash package; symbols for the new algorithms are defined in the
general hash unit, specific hash und HMAC units are available.

Int64 support for SHA384/512:  Unfortunately there are conflicting
processor specific results: on a P4 / 1.8GHz the speed decreases to 83% of
the longint speed (Cyc/B increase from 174 to 209). For a Celeron 500MHz
the speed increases more than 30%, the Cyc/B decrease from 146 (longint)
to 111 (Int64). In the source Int64 is default for D4+ and FPC
(conditional define UseInt64 in SHA512.PAS)

BASM16 table alignment: Because some BASM16 implementations use 32 bit
access to 32 bit tables, these tables should be dword aligned for optimal
speed. But the 16 bit compilers support byte or word alignment only!
Therefore the defines from the align.inc include file allow to generate
dummy words, which align the tables to 32 bit boundaries. This feature is
implemented for CRC24 ... CRC64; if more than one of these units are used,
it may be necessary to iterate the alignment procedure.

Pure Pascal versions: The source archive contains pure Pascal versions of
the basic routines without BASM (formerly published in a separate
archive). The main purpose is to supply sources for more portable code
(e.g. for Linux/ARM); consequently the code layout is for FPC with int64
and without asm, but it can be compiled with Delphi 4+. Pure Pascal
routines are invoked if the symbol PurePascal is defined: {$define
PurePascal}, forced for BIT64. For 32-bit systems the PP CRC routines are
significantly slower than the standard sources (see table), but the Hash
function speeds are not so uniform. The pure Pascal routines are 64-bit
compatible (tested with D17 and FPC 2.6.0 on Win64). Special thanks goes
to Nicola Lugato who asked for the pure Pascal units and tested the first
versions on his ARM/Linux machine.

RocksoftTM Model CRC Algorithm: The crcmodel unit is a Pascal
implementation of Ross William's parameterized model CRC algorithm
described in A Painless Guide to CRC Error Detection Algorithms. Most of
the usual CRC algorithms with polynomials up to degree 32 can be modeled
by this unit. The crcm_cat unit has predefined parameter records for more
than 50 CRC algorithms, most of them adapted from Greg Cook's Catalogue of
Parameterised CRC Algorithms, more references are listed in the unit
header. The GUI demo programs tcrc16/tcr32 interactively calculate and
display the results from all crcm_cat CRC16/CRC32 algorithms for hex and
string input, SRP16 searches CRC16 Rocksoft parameters for given data.
