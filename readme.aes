This archive contains AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) related Pascal /
Delphi sources: basic AES routines and recommended block cipher modes of
operation (with test programs that verify compilation and results).

The block level routines supply separate units for encryption and decryption.
The source code for basic encryption/decryption is split into several include
files. At the lowest level there are type definitions and common routines. Key
sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits are supported.

The following recommended block cipher modes of operation are implemented:
CBC, CFB128, CFB8, CTR, ECB, OFB, OMAC, CMAC, CCM, EAX, GCM, and XTS. All
chaining modes allow plain and cipher text lengths that need not be multiples
of the block length (for ECB and CBC cipher text stealing is used for the
short block; only one short block is allowed and there must be at least one
full block). CTR mode can use 4 built-in incrementing functions or a user
supplied one, and provides seek functions for random access reads.

All routines have been included in the AES_DLL.DLL, there are two interface
units for this DLL (one for Virtual Pascal, the second for the other Win32
compilers).

Since the July 2006 release there are conditional defines to support
compressed tables: one 2K encryption table (calculated with t_mkctab) replaces
the four 1K tables (same for decryption, here the inverse SBox is no longer
needed). Besides using less static memory, compressed tables are considered as
a countermeasure against cache timing attacks.
