The archive contains a collection of small units; in the past some of the
units were available separately. Online help is available as Windows .hlp file
or as a .tph for BP7 IDE.

* Base2N V0.38: General base 2**N conversion routines (N=1...6)
* Bitarray V0.17: Bit array context with max. 524160 bits (spin off from
  mpint 16 bit prime sieve)
* BTypes V0.12: Common basic type definitions
* Compvers V0.18: Compiler version as string or symbol
* Dates V0.33: Implements compiler and OS independent routines for the
  current date and time (including milliseconds since midnight) and functions
  for Julian day numbers.
* Fio V0.15: File IO with $I- and Err variable (without try/finally), simple
  wrapper calls for system routines.
* Hrtimer V0.23: Contains a high resolution timer for most Pascal/Delphi
  compilers using the comp data type. It uses the RDTSC instruction,
  therefore it will stop on machines that do not support RDTSC (this feature
  can be turned off via $ifdef). The timer is used by several optimizing test
  programs.
* Mem_util V0.94: Implements compiler independent routines for comparing
  memory blocks and converting memory blocks to HEX and Base64 strings.
* Ministat V0.43: Statistics unit with accurate "on the fly" statistics
  routines for one and two variables.
* Sort V1.18: General QuickSort, HeapSort (standard and bottom-up), CombSort
  routines using swap/compare functions. Additional pointer versions have a
  typeless data pointer that is carried through the functions and can be used
  to access local data etc by the caller.
* Tsc V0.35: This unit has a more low level access to the Time Stamp Counter
  than hrtimer and additionally defines a system dependent low resolution
  counter (GetTickCount, 18.2 Hz Systick, or milliseconds since midnight) if
  RDTSC support is not available.
