INSTALLATION
PeaZip is a natively portable application, it means that no installation procedure is strictly required to prepare the system to run it.
The program is released in two ways: as installable package (.deb, .rpm, .tgz) authomatically handling system integration, for ease of use, and as standalone .tar.gz package (peazip_portable).
To install the latter, unpack the content of the .tar.gz package in the directory you prefer; you can move the program's folder in another directory whenever you want (even on network or removable paths).

USAGE
To start PeaZip doubleclick (or launch by console) "peazip" binary. 
If the system finds unresolved dependencies while launching peazip binary for the first time, please follow the instructions of your installer manager to install the needed libraries (may be standard gtk/gdk related libraries, most of times libgdk_pixbuf library). 
If the program does not start and the system doesn't give any warning, try launching peazip from a console to get more detailed feedback.
